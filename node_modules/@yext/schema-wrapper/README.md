# schema-wrapper

NPM Package for generating JSON-LD schema markup from a Yext entity

Under `src/yextFields`, find adapter functions which take Yext fields (i.e. Address, Hours, CFTs, etc) and return a JSON object which matches the schema.org specifications

Under `src/schemaTypes`, find functions which represent larger schema.org types, which are composed of data from several Yext fields. These can be though of as Yext Entity level objects.
